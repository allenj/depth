During the 1970s and early 80s when ground water extracted from aquifers near Ship Creek was the principal source of supply, area-wide declines in ground-water levels resulted in near record low streamflows in Ship Creek. Since the importation of Eklutna Lake water in the late 1980s, ground-water use has been reduced and ground water has contributed 14-30 percent of the annual supply. As Anchorage grows, given the current constraints on the Eklutna Lake water availability, the increasing demand for water could place an increasing reliance on local ground-water resources.

Here water commonly flows between lakes and ground water, indicating interrelation between water quantity and quality. Thus concerns exist that poorer quality ground water may degrade local lake ecosystems. This concern has led to water-quality sampling in cooperation with the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. A map showing the estimated altitude of the water table illustrates potential ground-water flow directions and areas where ground- and surface-water exchanges and interactions might occur. Water quality measured [...]","webLinks":[{"type":"browseImage","uri":"http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/thumbnails/usgs_thumb.jpg","rel":"related","title":"jpg","hidden":false},{"type":"webLink","uri":"http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2006/1209/","rel":"related","title":"html","hidden":false},{"type":"webLink","uri":"http://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Prodesc/proddesc_77318.htm","rel":"related","title":"html","hidden":false},{"type":"webLink","uri":"http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20061209","rel":"related","title":"html","hidden":false}]},{"link":{"rel":"self","url":"https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/4f4e4affe4b07f02db697b10"},"relatedItems":{"link":{"url":"https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?json.id=4f4e4affe4b07f02db697b10","rel":"related"}},"id":"4f4e4affe4b07f02db697b10","title":"Water resources data Florida, water year 2004: Volume 3B: southwest Florida ground water","summary":"Water resources data for the 2004 water year in Florida consist of continuous or daily discharges for 405 streams, periodic discharge for 12 streams, continuous or daily stage for 159 streams, periodic stage for 19 streams, peak stage for 30 streams and peak discharge for 30 streams, continuous or daily elevations for 14 lakes, periodic elevations for 23 lakes; continuous ground-water levels for 408 wells, periodic ground-water levels for 1,188 wells, and quality-of-water data for 140 surface-water sites and 240 wells.

Contamination of the surficial aquifer system and availability of a potable water supply have become of increasing concern. The study consisted of sampling 11 ground-water wells and 14 surface- water sites for determination of major inorganic constituents and physical characteristics, trace metals, nitrogen and phosphorus species, and synthetic organic compounds. Sodium and chloride concentrations exceeded Florida drinking-water standards in ground water at two wells, dissolved- solids concentrations at five ground-water wells and one surface-water site, and color values [...]","webLinks":[{"type":"browseImage","uri":"http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1996/0495/report-thumb.jpg","rel":"related","title":"jpg","hidden":false},{"type":"webLink","uri":"http://sofia.usgs.gov/publications/ofr/96-495/","rel":"related","title":"html","hidden":false},{"type":"webLink","uri":"http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1996/0495/report.pdf","rel":"related","title":"pdf","hidden":false},{"type":"webLink","uri":"http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr96495","rel":"related","title":"html","hidden":false}]}]};
